38 - Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Pattern
Systematic exploration of multiple reasoning paths to find optimal solutions.

The Tree of Thoughts pattern enables agents to solve complex problems by exploring
multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure, evaluating and pruning branches to
systematically find the optimal solution. This approach is particularly effective
for problems that require systematic exploration, such as logic puzzles, constrained
planning, and multi-step reasoning tasks where the solution path is not immediately obvious.

This demonstrates:
1. Generate multiple thought branches from current state
2. Evaluate each branch using scoring criteria
3. Prune unpromising branches to focus resources
4. Expand promising branches with new thoughts
5. Find optimal solution through systematic search
