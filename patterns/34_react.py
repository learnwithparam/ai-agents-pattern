34 - ReAct (Reason + Act) Pattern
Dynamic reasoning and action loop for complex problem-solving.

The ReAct pattern enables agents to interleave reasoning steps with actions in a
continuous loop. Instead of planning all steps upfront, the agent generates a
thought about its immediate next step, takes an action (like calling a tool),
observes the result, and then uses that new information to generate its next
thought and action. This creates a dynamic and adaptive problem-solving process.

This demonstrates:
1. Think-Act-Observe loop for dynamic problem solving
2. Multi-step reasoning with tool integration
3. Adaptive planning based on real-time observations
4. Complex question answering through iterative exploration
